# image-to-speech
This is the project I have done in a course IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING in my last semester
In recent years we have developed our technology to an extent that we can perform the unexpected with ease. Technology makes our daily life easier. Starting from eBooks to online learning, in every industry digitalization is overpowering the flow of information. When we come across the concept of eBooks, we also need to focus upon the people who are visually impaired. For this we came across the concept of audio books and podcasts. To put a cherry on top, we present our research work which can help to convert any written text to text file and further present an audio file reading the given text aloud. This will not only help the visually impaired, but will also be helpful for the illiterate who now will be able to read the text with the use of the proposed methodology. Here we will be performing multiple processes on an image to extract the text and further convert that text to audio which will read out aloud the provided text. Using Optical Character Recognition and Text To speech conversion we are presenting our research work to implement the conversion of text in image to speech.
